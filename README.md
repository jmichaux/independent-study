These are my notes and solutions from the newest edition of Sutton and Barto's excellent book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. You will need to install [this Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima?hl=en) if you want to render mathematical symbols. 

Please note that there are bugs in some of the solutions.
